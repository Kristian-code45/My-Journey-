    <p> <h3><b>Profile</b></h3>
        I come from a family of farmers, so I have experience in agriculture. I graduated from the Electronic and Communication Engineering Education program at Surabaya State University. I gained knowledge about technology, especially at Robotic and Automation field, which can be applied to improve the farming industry. Additionally, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others, which has also helped me learn about education
